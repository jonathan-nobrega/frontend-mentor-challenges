# Frontend Mentor Challenges

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help me improve my coding skills by building realistic projects. Each folder inside `/challenges` correspond to a unique challenge from Frontend Mentor.

## Where to find everything

The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
